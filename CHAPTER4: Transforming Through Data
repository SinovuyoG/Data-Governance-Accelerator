CHAPTER4: Transforming Through Data 
Examining the Broader Value of Data 
The ability of team members to access data that they need for their work, without having to rely on specialists, is called data democratization. 
As organizations grow and more systems are employed, eventually no single person knows what data is available and where it is in the enterprise. Without this knowledge, the ability to properly govern your data and leverage its value is greatly hampered. Without deliberate actions, data democratization becomes elusive. 
•	Unfortunately, over time, the situation often deteriorates. Whether because of culture, strategy (or lack of strategy), systems design, budgets, mergers, or any number of other dynamics, data sets get siloed. 
•	 A data silo is a data repository controlled by an entity in an organization but not frequently shared or known by other parts of the business.  
•	Data silos hinder business efficiencies because they reduce collaboration and increase data inconsistencies.  
•	In addition, they are a source of risk, including security and regulatory issues. 
 
•	Data governance helps eliminate unnecessary data siloes and makes data discoverable and available whenever and wherever it adds value. 
•	Being able to tame and explore data sprawl — a term for the myriad of data types and sources that most businesses grapple with today — is not easily achieved without investing specialized effort. 
Knowing what data is available is essential for the following reasons: 
•	Better informed decision-making. 
•	Ensuring compliance and regulatory requirements. 
•	Lower costs by avoiding duplicate system and data efforts. 
•	Improved data analytics and reporting. 
•	Higher performing systems. 
•	More efficient operations. 
•	Reducing data inconsistencies across the enterprise. 
 
 
Data Catalogs 
 
Another, increasingly popular, method of data discoverability is the creation of an enterprise data catalog. 
The three essential benefits of data catalogs are: 
•	Finding data: Helps users identify and locate data that may be useful. 
•	Understanding data:  Answers a wide variety of data questions such as its purpose and who uses it. 
•	Making data more useful:  Creates visibility, describes value, and provides access to information. 
 Done right, a data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data. This view provides essential insight that helps with leveraging data value and provides a robust tool to assist with data governance.  
 
Figure 10 illustrates the basic building blocks of a data catalog. 
  
Figure 10: A basic orientation of the components of a data catalog 
•	A data catalog is more than just a list of all data sets. Sure, for many organizations, this feature alone would add enormous value.  
•	What makes a data catalog particularly valuable is that it contains data about the data. It’s called metadata.  
•	This content can be curated manually and also by automated processes which can acquire it from other sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now playing a growing role in the latter. 
 
A data catalog can contain three types of metadata: technical, business, and operational. 
•	Technical metadata:  Data about the design of a data set such as its tables, columns, file names, and other documentation related to the source system. 
•	Business metadata:  Organizational data such as a business description, how it is used, its relevancy, an assessment of data quality, and users and their interactions. 
•	Operational metadata:  Data such as when the data was last accessed, who accessed it, and when was it last backed up. 
Examples of metadata include the following: 
•	Associated systems. 
•	File names. 
•	File locations. 
•	Data owners. 
•	Data descriptions. 
•	Dates created. 
•	Dates last modified. 
•	List of database tables and views. 
•	Data stewards. 
•	Size of data sets. 
•	Quality score. 
•	Comments. 
For a large number of stakeholders ranging from data analysts to data stewards, a data catalog presents many advantages. Primarily, the ability to find data tops the list. But it provides much more than that. 
With a data catalog, an organization can: 
•	Know what data it has (and by extension, know what data is missing). 
•	Reduce data duplication. 
•	Increase operational efficiencies and innovation. 
•	Understand data quality. 
•	Manage compliance. 
•	Enjoy cost savings from improved operations. 
Case Study: Unlocking Data Silos With a Data Catalog

Background 
A European power company has embraced data governance in support of its mission of decarbonizing the production of electricity. The organization generates and distributes energy across multiple countries. Data is essential to every part of their business. For example, daily operations, like evaluating equipment performance, require deep data insights. Making data central to these tasks translates to considerable cost savings. 
Protecting data from misuse is also important. Not only must the business adhere to the regulatory requirements in all countries where they operate — but they must also comply with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which governs the use of personal data. Failure to do so can result in fines totaling millions of euros. 
Problem Statement 
The challenge facing the company was how to power its mission by enabling business units and partners to collaborate using the business and technical data locked away in siloed systems, while also ensuring a high degree of data compliance. 
The Solution 
They found a large part of the solution in the implementation of a data catalog with robust data governance functionality. 
The data catalog facilitated collaboration and innovation by enabling vastly improved search and discovery of data across the organization. In addition, team members could share their expertise through articles in the catalog, speeding the transfer of knowledge throughout the company. 
Compliance requirements were improved by the catalog interface guiding compliant behavior using workflows. In this way, the data catalog taught people how to use data compliantly and ensured they followed the relevant policies based on the data at hand. 
Results and Lessons Learned 
Today, data governance has become part of the company’s operational DNA. 
•	Lessons gleaned from their data governance journey included: 
•	Make data governance part of how all data users work with data, not an external task force or project. 
•	Start small and grow steadily. Once new users discovered how easy it was to find the data they needed, they became champions of the data governance program. 
Curate metadata facilitates data search and discovery across the organization. A business glossary helps define standard terminology to ensure that all users have a common understanding of critical business terms. 
By using a data catalog to put the right data into the right hands at the right time (with the right compliance guidance), the organization built trust in their data. This, in turn, generated efficiency and profitability, along with reduced risk.

From Data to Insights 
In a business context, deriving insights is almost the entire point of collecting data. 
In Chapter 2, we understood that raw data has little value until it is given context. It then becomes information, which becomes the basis for taking an action. Eventually, through the addition of experiences, practicalities, values, and other dimensions, data becomes insight. Insight provides a deep understanding of something and is the ultimate positive manifestation of data. It has the highest value to an organization because it can support decisions and drive actions. 
That last sentence is worth unpacking. Whether an organization uses insight to support decisions or drive actions is a choice. Most organizations will do some of both, but when insights are used primarily to drive action, the value of the underlying data is truly realized. Put another way, actionable data is the most valuable data to an organization. 
  
If you can’t use your data to make better decisions and drive your organization forward, the data may just be worthless. 
Acquiring and applying insight from data means defining the following: 
•	Context: Understanding the environment and objectives of the outcome 
•	Need: Determining how insight will help to accomplish the objective 
•	Vision: Having ideas about how insight will help and what that might look like in practice 
•	Outcome:  Specifying how insights will be adopted and success will be measured 
These dimensions can be used to answer questions such as: 
•	What data is required? 
•	Does the data exist? 
•	Is it current? 
•	Is it easily available? 
•	What format is the data in? 
•	What kind of data analysis is required? 
•	How will the data be presented? 
  
Converting data into insights is no easy task. It’s complicated and skilled work and relies on good quality data that is accessible. Those tasked with delivering insights often cite data quality, data volume, work effort, and integrating data from various sources as the top reasons that make it difficult and create a deterrent to adoption. 
The wrong actions taken in response to insights can have devastating business consequences. Trusting insights requires a high degree of confidence in both those producing the analytics and those receiving the results. While the vast majority of organizations want to rely on insights, recent surveys suggest that only a minority of leaders act on the insights provided. 
  
Quality insights can provide a competitive advantage and operational excellence, but organizations have work to do to fully realize their potential. 
 
 
 
 
Data Analytics 
•	Data analytics involves both specialized skills and software to explore data sets and extract insights that may be useful to an organization. 
•	Sometimes the term is used interchangeably with data analysis.  
•	Data analysis is concerned with identifying a data set, examining it, and reporting on any findings.  
•	It’s a subset of data analytics and it typically focuses on what data from the past tells us.  
•	On the other hand, data analytics is a complete science that involves collecting, cleaning, organizing, storing, administering, and analyzing data.  
•	In addition to informing you about the past, it is also used to help project possibilities into the future. 
 
The source of data for analytics is one or a combination of the following: 
•	First-party data:  Data that an organization collects. 
•	Second-party data:  Data that is obtained from another organization. 
•	Third-party data:  Aggregated data obtained from a provider. 
Typical uses of contemporary data analytics tools and techniques include: 
•	Vastly improved decision-making 
•	Focused marketing campaigns 
•	Understanding the competitive landscape 
•	Designing more innovative products 
•	Better customer service 
•	Improved operations 
•	Insights on customer behavior 
Any organization that is serious about increasing the use of data for a wide range of business purposes must be ready to govern its data analytics capabilities. This includes policies and procedures, experienced talent, and a suite of contemporary software tools. 
 
 
Data Monetization 
Intuitively, when something has a high value, it’s likely to be treated differently from things with little value. 
•	Without a process to place a price on a data set - called data valuation - the value of a given data set may be highly subjective and may differ considerably between the perspectives of team members. 
•	When data provides an economic benefit to an organization, it's called data monetization. It’s a succinct, albeit cruder, way to generally consider the ultimate role of data in a for-profit enterprise. 
•	Data valuation, while generally recommended in larger enterprises, is a requirement for advanced data monetization such as selling or licensing data. 
Many ways exist to determine data valuation. Here is a brief summary of a few methods. 
•	Cost value method:  Value is calculated by determining how much it costs to produce, store, and replace lost data. It’s a simple method and can be useful as a lightweight approach, but it is subjective and doesn’t necessarily account for the economic value that the data can produce. 
•	Market value approach:  Value is calculated by researching how comparable data is being priced in the open market. It’s a great approach if market-based comparable data exists but doesn’t work for the vast number of data sets that are not traded. 
•	Economic value approach:  Value is calculated by measuring the impact a data set has on the business’s bottom line. It’s a difficult approach because it may be nearly impossible to identify the specific value of the data relative to other contributors of value. 
•	With-and-without method:  Value is calculated by quantifying the impact on cash flow if a data set needs to be replaced. Scenarios with and without the data are explored and the difference between cash flow is used to determine data value. Like others, this can be challenging to pinpoint the specific impact of a data set. 
What’s clear from data valuation methods is that none of them are perfect. Above all, data valuation is very hard. But in practice don’t be discouraged. It’s hard for every type of organization. Fortunately, a number of providers are ready to help if you want outside assistance. 
Data-Driven Decision Making 
Simply stated, data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is the process of using data to drive business decisions. 
Organizations that excel at DDDM achieve it through deliberate actions and investments. Critically, there must be leadership support for a culture that advocates decisions rooted in data appreciation and analytics. Executives who demonstrate DDDM are role models for the entire enterprise. In practical terms, it also means enabling team members to have access to data, tools, and training. Ensuring the right people can use the right data at the right time requires data-security and data-use policies, both core functions of data governance. 
 
Consider this six-step process to data-driven decision-making: 
1.	Define the objectives:  This step involves understanding the objectives relative to the effort and their alignment with organizational goals. This will help you scope the work and define the metrics. In fact, it can be useful to define success and then work backward. For example, if you’re trying to increase sales in a particular region, you need to identify which metrics to capture in order to determine whether you achieved that objective. 
2.	Identify the data:  In addition to using a data catalogue, enterprise search, or similar, this step requires engaging with impacted stakeholders. Getting input from a diverse group of people and teams will help you scope the data. This may generate the need to gather data that doesn’t exist. You may need to consult with data stewards, data owners, and others with data governance responsibilities. 
3.	Prepare the data:  After Step 2, you'll understand the degree of preparation you need. If the problem you’re trying to solve is narrow and the data is easily accessible and high-quality, you’ll be in pretty good shape. In most cases, your situation is unlikely to be simple. The data necessary to meet your decision-making objectives will likely come in a variety of formats and will be in need of some remediation. You may need some deep data science skills to prepare the data for use in a data analytics platform. 
4.	Analyze the data:  Once you reach this point, the most exciting part begins. The assumption is that you’re using a useful analytics tool. For complex analysis and continuous efforts, several tools will be used. This could include support for an ETL architecture (Extract, Transform, and Load). This is when data is extracted from one system and made ready and available for use in another. To analyze this data, you will also need relevant representations such as visualizations. These could include graphs and charts. Your tool selection and how the data is presented will depend largely on the audience. For executives, a dashboard may be the right approach. 
5.	Determine the findings:  Once you have data that you can display in a variety of ways, you can ask questions about it. For example, if you’re trying to understand customer demographics relative to sales in a particular region, you may want to toggle between different age ranges. While all phases of DDDM have complexity, the tough work here is knowing which questions to ask. This skill is aided by training, but experience helps. 
6.	Take action:  That’s all there is to this step. Make your decisions. If you’ve completed Steps 1-5 well, but no action is taken (assuming that’s not the decision based on analyzing the data since concluding that no decision is necessary is, in fact, a decision), you’ve wasted a lot of time. DDDM is all about the decisions that result in actions. 
 
Developing a Data Strategy for Improved Results 
Consider these reasons that organizations don’t take a proactive approach to managing data: 
•	“If it ain’t broke”, why fix it? 
•	It’s too expensive and time-consuming to focus on data. 
•	It’s far too complicated. 
•	Data management and governance — what is that? 
 
Why does every organization need a data strategy? 
The purpose of any type of strategy is to agree on a set of guiding principles that inform decision-making in support of a desired outcome. In simple terms, it’s the roadmap on how to reach your goals. 
Creating a Data Strategy 
So, you’ve made the decision to create a data strategy. That’s great. Before jumping in, consider the following characteristics as a guide to your approach: 
•	Data maturity:  This can be defined simply as the degree to which the organization already uses and optimizes data and has experience and skills, as well as the quality of the existing data. All organizations use data, but there’s a big difference between those that have prioritized it for a long period and those just deciding to treat it as a strategic asset. For example, without some basic data standards, security policies, and a process to cleanse data, layering analytics on top of it will likely cause frustration and in the worst case, errors in the results. 
•	Industry and size: You can think of data prioritization through two frameworks: defense and offense. Defense deals with fundamental areas such as data security and quality. Offense is using data for insight management and market-facing initiatives. Every organization does both, but most emphasize one over the other depending on the industry and its size. For example, a healthcare company may prioritize a defense framework for data given the highly regulated nature of the industry. 
With data maturity, industry, and size considered, a commensurate data strategy should follow. If you run a small business, don’t let the bureaucracy of a complex data strategy become a burden. Equally, you won’t see positive results if you don’t apply the right level of sophistication to a data strategy if you work for a large, complex, and highly regulated organization. 
A data strategy should typically account for these five areas of data requirements: 
•	Identify:  To find and make data usable, it must be clearly defined and described. This includes a file name, a file format, and metadata. 
•	Store:  Design and develop the capabilities for supporting the place and process for hosting data and how it will be shared, accessed, and processed. 
•	Provision:  Determine the processes to share and reuse data and define the guidelines for access. 
•	Process:  Raw data must be transformed to become valuable. This includes processes for data cleansing, standardization, and integration with other data sets. 
•	Govern:  Institute processes to manage and communicate data policies for data use within the organization. 
Data requirements should consider these four data strategy components: 
•	Alignment with the business: A data strategy is a subset of the overall business strategy. This means the data strategy must support and advance the larger goals of the organization. When determining the goals of the data strategy, where possible, map them as clearly as possible to illustrate how they are in support of the business strategy. For example, the business may want to reduce customer acquisition costs. A data strategy will be a valuable way to identify potential customers with a higher likelihood of conversion to buyers. Keep in mind that the strategy of a business evolves constantly, sometimes slowly and other times quickly. Your data strategy has to evolve in sync, as appropriate. 
•	Identifying roles and responsibilities: A strategy requires people to take specific actions. Without action, a strategy is a worthless document. In the data strategy, you’ll want to document the different roles that team members will play. Most will be data consumers. These are the employees who access and use data. They will certainly have responsibilities. For example, there will be an expectation about how different classifications of data should be handled. If something is public, then that’s entirely different than something that’s confidential. However, the bulk of the responsibility for ensuring that a data strategy can be delivered and maintained will rest with team members such as the information technology staff, data scientists and analysts, data stewards and owners, and management. It will be quickly apparent that data strategy and data governance have overlapping and dependent goals.  
•	Data architecture: This area relates to the processes, systems, and applications that support working with data. Basic areas include defining data storage needs and analysis tools. It also includes items such as a data catalog, a data warehouse where data can be stored and made ready for analysis, and the methods and tools for data pipelines, moving data from a data source to a destination, and related ETL (extract, transform, and load) functions. A data strategy should support the scalability of your data architecture as well as have some flexibility as needs change. Note that data architecture is often the driver of choosing and designing data management processes and systems. 
•	Data management: This area is the broad umbrella of activities that manage the full lifecycle of data in an organization. It recognizes that data is a strategic asset and must have the attendant processes, procedures, policies, skills, and tools to ensure it is treated in such a manner. This includes areas such as the management of data security and privacy, quality, metadata, integration, master data management, and analytics. 
Data governance establishes the rules for data use, and data management ensures that, in the act of realizing data value in the organization, these rules are followed. For example, a data governance policy may state that data with a certain confidentiality classification may only be accessible by a specific role level in the organization. Data management will be the processes, tools, and staff that ensure that this governance rule is followed.

Managing and Monitoring Your Data Strategy 
 
All strategies must be open to periodic modification. It’s not realistic to expect a strategy to be fixed for its duration in a fast-moving business world. Your evolving customer expectations, organizational needs, the economy, and more all play a role in forcing a strategy to adapt. 
 
Monitoring your data strategy means having the right metrics, getting feedback regularly from participants, and auditing related outcomes. 
All strategies, including your data strategy, must be regularly reviewed and modified as necessary. This is a core characteristic of an agile organization in the 21st century.
